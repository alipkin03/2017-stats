group project for stats class

Upload scripts for the group project here. You can add files and edit files through the online interface, or you can use terminal commands to download and upload code. This will make it a bit easier to sync with the current repository.

If you're changing a file, it's good practice to make a new branch and create a pull request. Then you can compare the differences to the previous version and merge the branches.

The good news about GitHub is you can always go back a version. So if you acccidentally delete a file or overwrite something, you can revert to the previous version.
